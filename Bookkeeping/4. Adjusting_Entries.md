# Adjusting Entries

Adjusting entries are journal entries made at the end of an accounting period to ensure that the company's financial records accurately reflect the accrual basis of accounting. These entries are necessary because some transactions may not have been recorded during the period or may not have been recorded accurately. Adjusting entries help ensure that revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when incurred, regardless of when cash is exchanged.

Five common adjusting entries are revenue accruals, expense accruals, revenue deferrals, expense deferrals and estimates.
