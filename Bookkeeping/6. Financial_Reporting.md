7# Financial Reporting

Financial reporting is the process of documenting and communicating financial activities and performance over specific time periods, typically on a quarterly or yearly basis. Companies use financial reports to organize accounting data and report on current financial status.

The five key documents include your profit and loss statement, balance sheet, cash-flow statement, tax return, and aging reports.
