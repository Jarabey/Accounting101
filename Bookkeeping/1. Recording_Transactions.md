# Recording Transactions
### Invoice

Invoices and receipts have different purposes as they're issued at different stages of the sales process. Invoices are issued prior to the customer sending the payment, whereas a receipt is issued after the payment has been received. The invoice acts as a request for payment, and the receipt acts as a proof of payment.

### Journal Entries

Each journal entry contains the data significant to a single business transaction, including the date, the amount to be credited and debited, a brief description of the transaction and the accounts affected. Depending on the company, it may list affected subsidiaries, tax details and other information.
