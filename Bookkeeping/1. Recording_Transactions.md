# Recording Transactions
### Invoice

Invoices and receipts have different purposes as they're issued at different stages of the sales process. Invoices are issued prior to the customer sending the payment, whereas a receipt is issued after the payment has been received. The invoice acts as a request for payment, and the receipt acts as a proof of payment.

### Journal Entries

Each journal entry contains the data significant to a single business transaction, including the date, the amount to be credited and debited, a brief description of the transaction and the accounts affected. Depending on the company, it may list affected subsidiaries, tax details and other information.

### Entries to Ledgers

A ledger entry is a record made of a business transaction. The entry may be made under either the single entry or double entry bookkeeping system, but is usually made using the double entry format, where the debit and credit sides of each entry always balance.
