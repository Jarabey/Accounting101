### Invoice

Invoices and receipts have different purposes as they're issued at different stages of the sales process. Invoices are issued prior to the customer sending the payment, whereas a receipt is issued after the payment has been received. The invoice acts as a request for payment, and the receipt acts as a proof of payment.
