# Reconciliations

In accounting, reconciliation is the process of ensuring that two sets of records are in agreement. It is a general practice for businesses to create their balance sheet at the end of the financial year as it denotes the state of finances for that period.

Comparison and adjustment of financial records to ensure accuracy and integrity. Examples: bank reconciliation, accounts receivable, and accounts payable reconciliation.
