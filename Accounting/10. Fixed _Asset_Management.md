## Fixed Asset Management

Fixed asset management refers to the process of acquiring, tracking, maintaining, and disposing of fixed assets effectively to maximize their value and ensure proper accounting treatment. Fixed assets, also known as property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), are long-term tangible assets used in the production or operation of a business.

### Key Aspects of Fixed Asset Management:

1. **Acquisition**: 
   - Fixed assets are acquired through purchase, construction, or other means. Proper documentation, including purchase invoices, contracts, and asset descriptions, should be maintained to record the acquisition cost accurately.

2. **Depreciation**:
   - Fixed assets are subject to depreciation, representing the allocation of their cost over their useful life. Depreciation methods such as straight-line, declining balance, or units of production are applied to spread the cost systematically.
   - Example: A company purchases machinery for $100,000 with an estimated useful life of 5 years and no salvage value. Using the straight-line depreciation method, the annual depreciation expense would be $20,000 ($100,000 / 5).

3. **Maintenance and Repairs**:
   - Regular maintenance and repairs are essential to ensure fixed assets remain in good working condition and retain their value over time. Maintenance activities should be documented to track costs and assess the asset's condition.

4. **Disposal**:
   - When fixed assets are no longer needed or become obsolete, they may be sold, scrapped, or otherwise disposed of. Disposal proceeds and related expenses are recorded, and any gain or loss on disposal is recognized in the financial statements.
   - Example: A company sells a vehicle for $10,000, which originally cost $15,000. The company records a loss on disposal of $5,000 ($10,000 - $15,000) in the income statement.

### Importance of Fixed Asset Management:

- Accurate fixed asset management ensures proper accounting treatment and compliance with financial reporting standards.
- Effective management of fixed assets maximizes their lifespan and minimizes downtime, reducing operational disruptions.
- Proper depreciation accounting reflects the true economic value of fixed assets and helps in making informed financial decisions.

In summary, fixed asset management is crucial for businesses to optimize the use of their long-term assets, maintain financial accuracy, and support strategic decision-making.
